# API Integration in website

### API Integration

Our SER API is seamlessly integrated into your Flask-based website. The API processes audio input, analyzes emotional cues, and returns emotion labels and insights.

### Real-Time Processing

Users can interact with your website using voice or audio input. The Flask server communicates with the SER API to analyze emotions as users speak.

### Personalized Responses

Leverage emotion data to personalize responses, recommendations, or actions. Your website can adapt in real-time based on the detected emotions, creating a more engaging user journey.
