            <h3>Why Speech Emotion Recognition?</h3>
            <p>Emotions are at the core of human communication. They convey feelings, intentions, and states of mind
                that enrich our interactions with one another. In today's digital age, where communication extends
                beyond face-to-face interactions, understanding and recognizing emotions in speech are more important
                than ever.</p>
